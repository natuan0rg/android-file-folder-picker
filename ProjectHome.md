This is an Android Library project which can be incorporated into other Android applications which require a simple efficient File/Folder picker

## What can the Picker Do? ##
  * Pick Files/Directories/both
  * Pick Multiple items(Single item mode, Multi item mode)
  * Show or hide hidden files/directories
  * Filter files based on extensions
  * Separate icons to represent files of each Mime Type
  * Start in a specified initial Directory (By default it is / )

## How to use the Picker? ##
Using the picker is quite self explanatory.

However if you want to select Directories instead of browsing them, then you will have to long press on the directory(or check  the CheckBox if available).
If you want to traverse back(to the parent directory), use the back button on your phone.
